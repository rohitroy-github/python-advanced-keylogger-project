# python-advanced-keylogger-project
This is an advanced keylogger program made using python which captures keystroke, live screenshots, microphone recording, system information &amp; clipboard information. I created this as a part of my college project in 2nd Year. A working sample for this project is available at https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QbSTzdlzAb5sndil_rSokan2JiqaF6_R/view?usp=sharing
